<h4>Membership</h4>
  <p>oSTEM members receive discounted tickets. Member discounts stack with early-bird discounts.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you are not currently a member, you can <a href='https://ostem.org/page/how-to-join-ostem'>become one on our Join oSTEM page</a>.</li>
    <li>Members will need their <b>Member ID</b> to purchase tickets at the member rate. To find your Member ID, sign in to oSTEM.org, go to your profile, and then navigate to 'Accounts + Settings'. Direct link: https://ostem.org/members/edit.asp*</li>
  </ul>
<br/>

<h4>Group Tickets</h4>
  <p>We are piloting group tickets this year, allowing collegiate chapters and companies to purchase tickets for their members in bulk. Select "Collegiate (Member) - Group Tickets" or "Professional (Member) - Group Tickets" on the registration page to use this option.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Group and individual tickets cost the same, but you may purchase up to 30 in one transaction instead of 10.</li>
    <li>All attendees under a set of group tickets must be oSTEM members. Group tickets are not available for non-members.</li>
    <li>You may buy blank group tickets first and then fill in attendee names on a later day.</li>
    <li>All blank tickets must be filled out by the regular ticket deadline (9/30).</li>
    <li>Group tickets cannot be partially refunded. Blank tickets that are not completed by the deadline will be cancelled without a refund.</li>
  </ul>

<h4>oSTEM Gala</h4>
<p><strong>Join us for the Gala — the perfect way to round off the conference!</strong></p>
<p>This year’s Gala will feature light refreshments, music and dancing, space to connect with fellow attendees, and a special recognition of members of the oSTEM community. It's your chance to celebrate the weekend, the connections you've made, and the achievements of our community throughout the year.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gala tickets are an optional, paid add-on - they are <b className='text-nav-pink'>not included</b> with your conference pass. Each attendee needs their own add-on ticket. Gala tickets are not available for on-site purchase.</li>
  <li>Gala is on Saturday night. Please refer to <a href='schedule'>our high-level schedule</a> or our <a href='about'>What to Expect page</a> for more details.</li>

### Common Questions

</div>

#### My employer is exhibiting/sponsoring the conference and pre-purchased my registration. How do I register? 
If you are registering as part of your company's exhibitor/sponsorship package, you should receive instructions from your company's conference contact. They will be given a private Whova link and promo code for the company's representatives to redeem their pre-paid registrations. If you have questions, please contact sponsorship@ostem.org.

#### What if I miss the online deadline? Will there be on-site registration?
If you miss the online registration deadline (September 26), you will be able to register on-site. Please note that on-site registration will be more expensive than online prices, will not include any meals, and will only have limited accomodations available.

No exceptions will be made for online registration after the deadline. There is no "late" online registration option this year.

#### Are registration discounts available?
Yes, oSTEM members get a discounted rate. Furthermore, the member discount stacks with the early-bird discount allowing you to save more if you purchase your ticket by June 30.

#### I submitted a RFP/RFPT. When should I register?
Attendees with an accepted [Request for Programs (RFP)](/2025/present/request-for-programs) or [Request for Panel Topics (RFPT)](/2025/present/request-for-panel-topics) submission will receive a 50% registration discount\* on their conference pass. As such, you should hold off registration until you hear whether your submission was accepted or not.

\* There is a limit on how many discounted tickets you can purchase. Please view the respective RFP and RFPT pages for more information.

#### What if I miss the early-bird deadline waiting for a RFP/RFPT decision?

Your submission decision will likely come after June 30. As a thank you for submitting a proposal, we will honor the early bird rate anytime before the September 30 regular cut off. You will receive instructions for this with your decision email.

#### What if I miss the early-bird deadline for any other reason?
We are only offering extended early-bird registration for attendees who have submitted a RFP or RFPT (see above). No other exceptions will be made.

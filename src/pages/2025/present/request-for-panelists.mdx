## 2025 Program Tracks and Updates
</div>

Based on previous feedback, oSTEM is excited to introduce two general conference tracks, and four specialized tracks for the 2025 edition: Collegiate, Industry, Government and Community Organizations, and Technical Spotlight. Please read a little bit about each track in order to decide which track is best suited for your submission. All submissions are expected to be in workshop format. Workshops are defined as 1-2 speakers presenting on a program topic. *All workshops are expected to be 50 minutes.*


**Collegiate:** This track is focused for individuals who regularly interact with a student population or hold positions that are based in academia. Submissions for this track will be applicable to undergraduate, graduate, and faculty/staff positions in order to build a network of tools and resources to take back to the participant’s home institution. 

**Industry:** This track aims to engage individuals that are currently in the workforce or are imminently prepared to enter the workforce. Potential workshop topics include how to better engage your employer, advocate for LGBTQ+ populations during your work day, build career-development skills, or shape your professional brand.

**Government and Community Organizations:**  Programming in this track will focus on the intersections between science and society. Workshops should engage conference attendees who are current employees of or interested in working for nonprofits, community organizations, political thinktanks, and/or local, state, or federal government. Examples of topics for this track include the role of scientists in government agencies, science policy and law, and utilizing science in advocacy work.

**Technical Spotlight:** Topics for this track will be extremely focused on the highly technical aspects of the presented topic. Presenters will be professionals who already belong to this field or want to appreciate the intricacies of the field. These submissions are more focused and it is expected that the audience will have foundational knowledge of the topic being discussed. For the 2025 Conference, our programs will focus on AI and Machine Learning, Research and Study Design in LGBTQ+ Population, and Sustainable Engineering.

The general conference will have two tracks. More information about these panels can be found below:

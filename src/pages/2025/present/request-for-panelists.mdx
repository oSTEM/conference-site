### General Conference Panels

#### Panel 1: From Burnout to Balance: Self-Care Strategies for Managing Mental Health

</div>

In high-pressure STEM environments, burnout can affect everyone— undergraduates, grad students, and professionals alike. This panel will explore practical self-care strategies to help LGBTQ+ individuals manage mental health, prevent burnout, and find balance across all stages of their STEM careers. Panelists will share insights on how to navigate the unique challenges in academia and the workplace, prioritize well-being, and build resilience for long-term success.

#### Panel 2: A Sacred Intersection: Faith, Queer Identity, and Personal Truth

</div>

For many LGBTQ+ individuals, navigating the intersection of faith and queer identity can be a complex and deeply personal journey. This panel will explore how individuals reconcile their spiritual beliefs with their queer identities, offering insights into the challenges and affirmations that come with embracing both. Panelists will share their unique stories and discuss how to foster inclusive, supportive spaces for others walking similar paths. Whether you are reconciling your own identities or seeking to better understand this intersection, this panel provides space for reflection, conversation, and connection.

Curious about what it's like to be LGBTQ+ in med school— or nursing, pharmacy, vet school, or any other healthcare path? This panel brings together students from across the healthcare spectrum to talk about how they got where they are, what it's really like, and how they're balancing their identities with their training. Whether you're pre-med, pre-vet, or just exploring the world of healing professions, come hear real stories, ask your questions, and get inspired by folks who've been in your shoes.

Hear from professionals working at the intersection of science and social justice who are advocating for LGBTQ+ rights, shaping public policy, and making change within community and government spaces.

From AI and sustainable design to community-centered research, panelists will share how they're rethinking what environmental justice can be— technically, ethically, and inclusively.

## Overview

</div>

The 2025 oSTEM Annual Conference Poster Session is intended for any researcher to showcase their research to other conference attendees. Presenters will have the opportunity to opt into judging and poster prizes will be awarded in the following categories: Best Undergraduate Research Poster, Best Graduate Research Poster, and Best Post-Doctoral Research Poster. We will also facilitate the “People’s Choice” poster competition where conference participants are able to select their favorite poster!

Poster awards will first be evaluated by the quality of the abstract submitted and the judging panel will select the top posters in each category to judge their poster presentation. Presenters will be notified the week before the conference if their poster will be visited for poster judging.

All abstract submissions should be submitted following the NIH Structured Abstracts guidelines.

Participants also have the opportunity in the same form to submit their work for a research talk. This will use the same abstract submission as the poster presentation. Research talks will be 10 minutes in length followed by 5 minutes for questions immediately following the presentation. These will occur during the workshop blocks throughout the weekend.

For full consideration for research talks, please submit prior to July 30, 2025. The final deadline to submit a poster is September 1, 2025. Poster submissions are considered on an ongoing basis.

## F.A.Q.

</div>

- **I have a conflict with the times listed. Can you alter the presenting schedule to fit my needs?**  
  We cannot accommodate scheduling limitations. Submissions are expected to be available throughout the weekend for a research talk or Saturday for poster presentations.

- **What are the recommended poster dimensions?**  
  The maximum poster dimensions are 48" wide by 36" high.

- **How will the posters be displayed?**  
  We display the posters on an 8’ by 4’ free-standing cork board with push pins.

- **Do I need to bring my poster/can you print it for me?**  
  Unfortunately, oSTEM cannot print your poster. We advise that you travel with your poster. However, a full-service FedEx Office Print & Ship Center is located at 11 S Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21201 near the conference center.

- **How will I know if my poster was accepted for a research talk?**  
  If you indicate you are interested in a research talk, you will be contacted with the time and location of your presentation on or before August 21, 2025. Poster acceptances are rolling, so you will likely receive a poster confirmation before your research talk.

- **When can I set my poster up?**  
  Poster setup will start at 8:00 AM on Saturday morning and be available throughout the day; feel free to wander through the posters during the day.

## Community Health is Important!

</div>

At the oSTEM Annual Conference, our primary objective is to create an environment where every attendee feels safe and supported. With participants traveling from across the nation and the world, it is essential that we all contribute to maintaining a healthy and safe community. Community health is a cornerstone of our history and the diverse communities we represent.

### Masks are strongly encouraged

</div>

Masks are strongly encouraged for those who can wear them. They should make a tight seal covering the nose and the mouth. N95 or equivalent masks (e.g., KN95) are recommended. 

<div className="text-nav-blue">

### Immunizations and boosters are strongly recommended

</div>

Influenza activity typically begins in October and globally, COVID-19 remains an active threat to health. Additionally, the World Health Organization has declared mpox (formerly monkeypox) a public health emergency of global concern. 
<br />

To protect yourself and others, we encourage attendees to stay up-to-date with applicable immunizations and boosters before attending the conference. See the end of this page for more resources.

### Rapid tests are encouraged

</div>

To help safeguard our community, we encourage attendees to take a rapid test before traveling to the conference. Testing can help prevent the spread of transmissible illnesses, allowing everyone to fully engage in the conference. Please note that most rapid/home testing kits require multiple tests over several days, so plan accordingly by following the included instructions.

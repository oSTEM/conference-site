### Lodging

</div>

<h4 className='text-green-900 dark:text-green-100'>General Lodging Information</h4>

To accomodate the increasing number of attendees each year, we are excited to announce that for the first time ever we are offering <b>multiple discounted hotels</b> this year. Because of this, please note the following:

- There are three general hotels that can be reserved by any attendee.
  - All hotels are within 5 blocks of both the convention center and the light rail station.
  - A limited, private hotel block which is adjacent to the convention center is available for attendees who need to be closer for accessibility and/or mobility reasons. If you need this, contact conference@ostem.org. 
- Hotel blocks are first come, first served.
  - This page will be updated weekly to indicate remaining capacity at each hotel. Once a hotel is full, you will not be able to make any reservations under our block rate and must instead pick a different hotel.
  - Blocks may run out before we update this website. If no rooms are available for a particular link, then that hotel block is **full**.

<h4>Group Tickets</h4>
  <p>We are piloting group tickets this year, allowing collegiate chapters and companies to purchase tickets for their members in bulk. Select "Collegiate (Member) - Group Tickets" or "Professional (Member) - Group Tickets" on the registration page to use this option.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Group and individual tickets cost the same, but you may purchase up to 30 in one transaction instead of 10.</li>
    <li>All attendees under a set of group tickets must be oSTEM members. Group tickets are not available for non-members.</li>
    <li>You may buy blank group tickets first and then fill in attendee names on a later day.</li>
    <li>All blank tickets must be filled out by the regular ticket deadline (9/30).</li>
    <li>Group tickets cannot be partially refunded. Blank tickets that are not completed by the deadline will be cancelled without a refund.</li>
  </ul>
<br/>

<h4>oSTEM Ga(y)la</h4>
<p>Join us for Ga(y)la, the perfect way to round off the conference. This is your chance to celebrate the weekend, the connections you've made and the achievements of our community throughout the year, complete with dinner and entertainment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ga(y)la tickets are an optional, paid add-on - they are <b className='text-nav-pink'>not included</b> with your conference pass. Each attendee needs their own add-on ticket.</li>
  <li>Ga(y)la is on Saturday night. Please refer to <a href='schedule'>our high-level schedule</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>

### Common Questions

</div>

#### What if I miss the online deadline? Will there be on-site registration?
If you miss the online registration deadline (September 30th), you will be able to register on-site. Please note that on-site registration will be more expensive than online prices, will not include any meals, and will only have limited accomodations available.

No exceptions will be made for online registration after the deadline. There is no "late" online registration option this year.

#### Are registration discounts available?
Yes, oSTEM members get a discounted rate. Furthermore, the member discount stacks with the early-bird discount allowing you to save more if you purchase your ticket by June 30th.

#### I submitted a RFP/RFPT. When should I register?
Attendees with an accepted [Request for Programs (RFP)](/2024/present/request-for-programs) or [Request for Panel Topics (RFPT)](/2024/present/request-for-panel-topics) submission will receive a 50% registration discount\* on their conference pass. As such, you should hold off registration until you hear whether your submission was accepted or not.

We do not expect to finish judging submissions by June 30th, however we understand that attendees may want the early-bird rate if their submission is not accepted. Therefore, this year we will offer extended early-bird registration rates to all program/panel topic applicants regardless of whether your submission is accepted. **Please do not register until you receive a status update on your submission.**

\* There is a limit on how many discounted tickets you can purchase. Please view the respective RFP and RFPT pages for more information.

#### I missed the early-bird deadline. Can I still get the early-bird rate?
If you submitted a RFP or RFPT (see above), you will still be able to register at the early-bird rate after it closes. No other exceptions will be made.

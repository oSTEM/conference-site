### Tickets

</div>

<TopicSquare title="Conference Ticket Pricing" borderColor="border-nav-green">

Please pay attention to ticket deadlines, as they are **significantly earlier** than previous years. Ticket sales will open on June 1, 2024.

<p><b className='text-red-600 dark:text-red-300'>All online ticket sales will close on September 30.</b> No exceptions will be made. If you miss the online ticket window, you may purchase tickets on-site for an additional cost. On-site tickets do not come with any food vouchers or special accommodations.</p>

  <h4>Group Tickets</h4>
  <p>New this year, collegiate chapters may purchase tickets for their members in bulk. Select "Collegiate (Member) - Group Tickets" on the registration page to use this option. This option is useful if you (a) want to take advantage of early-bird pricing but don't have a finalized attendee list yet, or (b) are purchasing a large number of tickets under a chapter.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Group tickets cost the same as regular tickets, but you may purchase up to 99 in one transaction instead of 10.</li>
    <li>All attendees under a set of group tickets must be oSTEM members. Group tickets are not available for non-members.</li>
    <li>You may buy blank group tickets first (i.e., to get early-bird pricing) and then fill in attendee names on a later day.</li>
    <li>All blank tickets must be filled out by the regular ticket deadline (9/30).</li>
    <li>Group tickets cannot be partially refunded. Blank tickets that are not completed by the deadline will be cancelled without a refund.</li>
  </ul>

### Previous Conference Information

</div>

While 2024 Conference Registration hasn't opened yet, you can take a look at last year's registration to get a sense of what registration generally looks like. We plan on continuing to offer similar ticket tiering (discounted member pricing, discounted early-bird pricing, and expo-only options), however, you can expect registration to open sometime in June instead of August this year.

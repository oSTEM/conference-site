## Overview

</div>

The oSTEM Annual Conference Poster Session is intended for any researcher to showcase their research to other conference attendees. Presenters will have the opportunity to opt into judging and poster prizes will be awarded in the following categories: Best Undergraduate Research Poster, Best Graduate Researcher, and Best Post-Doctoral Research. We will also facilitate the “People’s Choice” poster competition where conference participants are able to select their favorite poster! Poster awards will first be evaluated by the quality of the abstract submitted and the judging panel will select the top posters in each category to judge their poster presentation. Presenters will be notified the week before the conference if their poster will be visited for poster judging.  

All abstract submissions should be submitted following the NIH Structured Abstracts guidelines. 
Participants also have the opportunity in the same form to submit their work for a research talk. This will use the same abstract submission as the poster presentation. Research talks will be 10-minutes in length followed by 5-minutes for questions immediately following the presentation. These will occur during the workshop blocks throughout the weekend.  

For full consideration for research talks, please submit prior to September 1, 2024. The final deadline to submit a poster is September 30, 2024. Poster submissions are rolling acceptance.

## F.A.Q

</div>

- **What are the recommended poster sizes?**

  The maximum poster dimensions are 48" (wide) x 36" (tall).

- **Do I need to bring my poster? Can you print it for me?**

  Unfortunately, oSTEM cannot print your poster. We advise that you travel with
  your poster. Alternatively, a full service FedEx Office Print & Ship Center is located at 1605 NE 7th Ave, Portland, OR 97232 near the conference center.

- **Do students participating in the poster session receive a conference registration discount?**

  No, participating in the poster session alone will not give you a conference discount. If you're interested in submitting a program proposal or panel topic proposal, you can get a discount there should your proposal be accepted.

- **How will I know if my poster was accepted for a research talk?**  

  If you indicate you are interested in a research talk, you will be contacted with the time and location of your presentation by the end of September. Poster acceptances are rolling, so you will likely receive a poster confirmation before your research talk. 

- **When can I set my poster up?**
  
  Poster setup will be on Saturday morning and be available throughout the day on Saturday; feel free to take a moment free to wander through the posters during the day.

- **I have a conflict with the times listed. Can you alter the presenting schedule to fit my needs?**

  We cannot accommodate scheduling limitations. Submissions are expected to be available throughout the weekend for a research talk or Saturday for poster presentations.

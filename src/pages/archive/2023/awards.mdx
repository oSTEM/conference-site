## Frequently Asked Questions

</div>

### What are the rules?

- You can nominate as many people and/or chapters as you want for the same or
  multiple awards.
- Anyone can nominate, regardless of whether they are a member of your oSTEM
  chapter or not. Students, alumni, staff, friends, family, sponsors, event
  attendees, people you've worked with, school teachers and members of the
  public are all welcome to submit nominations.
- Don't hesitate to nominate yourself or your chapter! After all, you have the
  best understanding of your own achievements and what deserves to be
  celebrated.

### What makes a good nomination?

Writing nominations can be a challenge. You may know this person or chapter is
amazing and it's often difficult to express this in a few words. Here are some
hints and tips for what makes a good nomination:

<div className="my-4">

- **Quality over quantity:** While it's fantastic to have numerous individuals
  interested in nominating the same person or activity, keep in mind that the
  quantity of nominations does not carry weight in the judges' decision-making
  process. They are primarily seeking high-quality and impactful submissions.
- **Emphasize impact:** Highlight the impact of the person or chapter you're
  nominating. For instance, if they organized a panel, specify how many people
  showed up. Showcasing tangible outcomes demonstrates the impact.
- **Seek inspiration from previous winners:** Take some time to read about the
  achievements of previous award recipients. Reading about their accomplishments
  can serve as a valuable source of inspiration and guide you in crafting an
  outstanding nomination.
- **Provide ample details:** When nominating someone or a chapter, make sure to
  include as much information as possible. You already know how amazing they
  are, so convey that to the judges by giving them a comprehensive picture of
  everything.
- **Assume no prior knowledge:** Remember that the judging panel may have no
  prior knowledge about the person or activity you're discussing. Therefore, let
  them know and use concrete examples to illustrate why the nominee or their
  accomplishments are exceptional.

</div>

### When are the winners announced?

Winners will be announced via our social media and email. We will also be coming
together to celebrate our winners in person at the award ceremonies during our
annual conference this year in Anaheim, CA.

### Who decides the winners?

The awards will be judged by a panel of membership volunteers. Across the
membership team is a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences. Identifiable
information such as chapter name and nominee name will be removed from the
nomination to reduce bias by the Head Judge. All those judging will be asked to
declare their biases in advance and will be requested by the Head Judge to not
be involved in any decisions where they are deemed to have a conflict of
interest. All judging will take place in September.

### What is oSTEM's data policy with the nominations?

- Only members of the oSTEM Inc. Membership team will have access to the
  nomination data.
- Your data will not be shared and you have the right to request all nominations
  submitted to your name.
- Judges will receive copies of nominations only; no information on the
  nominator will be shared.
- You have the right to withdraw your nomination at any time before the judging.
  Simply email membership@ostem.org.
- All award winners will be published on our social media and website. You have
  the right to opt-out by emailing membership@ostem.org.

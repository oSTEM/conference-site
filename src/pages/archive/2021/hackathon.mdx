The hackathon returns again at this year's virtual conference. We're looking for enthusiastic students
and mentors with skills in software development who are interested in using technology and engineering
to solve problems for the queer community. We encourage our teams to develop functional prototypes that
could potentially be developed into fully working applications or solutions one day.

## How does the Hackathon work?

At the hackathon, we form small teams of student-led groups
(balancing experience and skill, and sometimes pairing with professional mentors from industry)
to build an app, website, game, or other technology that solves a challenge related to a real-world
need for our partner organization. Teams will be formed a few days before the main conference and
work at their own discretion remotely on selected challenge-sets we present.  At the end of the
"hacking" duration, teams demo of their solution to a panel of judges. Awards will be presented
during a main conference plenary session with an assortment of prizes provided by our sponsors.

but this time is fully at each team's discretion in terms of how much time commitment
is needed to produce a winning prototype.  During "Hacking" hours listed above,
the oSTEM Technology Team will be staffing volunteers and be available to assist or
answer any questions participants have--but this does not preclude teams from working
outside of these listed hours.)*

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is a hackathon?**  
A hackathon is an event where people get together and collaborate in teams to develop
new ideas into realities. Hackathons usually involve developing technology like apps,
websites, or other types of programs from scratch. Individuals of various levels of coding
experience from novice to expert are encouraged to join!


**Who can join the hackathon?**  
Anyone can register for the hackathon but we strongly encourage oSTEM student members to
lead and participate in the teams! We're also looking for professionals of all skill levels
to be hackathon coaches and mentors to work alongside our student teams.  Just register for
the conference using the link above and be sure to select the hackathon add-on option.


**How much time does the hackathon take?**  
This year the hackathon is 100% virtual and largely meant to be worked on with your small team directly.
*Keep in mind that the hackathon precedes the actual main conference and requires a time commitment.*
You should plan for a few hours of team formation, Q&A, sponsorship chats, optional social time,
and at least ~20-30 min demonstration time with your team.  We anticipate we will have a 2-3 day window
for teams to work, but this time is fully at each team's discretion in terms of how much time
commitment is needed to produce a winning prototype.  We want you to have a valuable experience
and win some cool prizes, but we also don't expect you to code 24x7 and be too exhausted to enjoy the conference.


**How much does the hackathon cost?**  
The hackathon only requires your time and hard work - we will not charge you for participating.
And our generous sponsors take care of all the logistical aspects and prizes for the event!


**What do I need to participate?**  
oSTEM will provide the virtual platforms, video conferencing technology, and real-time
messaging systems for you to interact with your teams and coordinate your work remotely.
You should have a laptop, desktop, or mobile device with a camera and microphone / speakers / headset
that will let you work with your team to both build and present your solution to the judges.


**What platforms will we use?**  
oSTEM is providing all conference logistical platforms including WebEx for meetings/sessions, 
Slack for real-time communication and team collaboration, and GitHub for source control.
We will also be using Gather, which is a virtual space to allow for easier socialization and interaction.


**I am a professional part of a company/organization, how can I get involved?**  
You can participate in the hackathon yourself by helping mentor and assist students in creating their prototypes.
Our teams really value getting to work alongside mentors and professionals who work in product
teams for a day-job and we'd love to plug you in to a team.  Just register for the hackathon normally
and once we have the student teams assigned, we'll take a survey of our mentors and get you paired
up with a team. As our hackathon's are student-led, we ask that you merely advise and consult--while
giving the students the space and coaching to lead the team and drive their product solutioning.


**Do I need technical skills to participate?**  
You should be basically "techie" in order to enjoy the full experience at the hackathon, 
but you do not need to be skilled in any particular technology area.
We will form small teams that prioritize engineers, designers, and programmers as the core of the group.
But we need project managers, artists, organizers, writers, testers, and presenters as well.
If you have any of these types of skills and want to have a great time building something 
new with a team of geeks, then the hackathon is for you!

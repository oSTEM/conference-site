## Presentation Format

There are two options for Program Submissions:

- **Workshop**: We define a workshop as 1-2 speakers presenting on a program
  topic. All workshops are expected to be 60 minutes, a 50 minute presentation
  with 10 minutes for Q&amp;A at the end of the session.

- **Panel**: We define a panel as 3-6 speakers that each contribute a unique
  perspective on a similar topic. Panels can be collaborative across different
  universities, companies, and industries depending on the topic. Members
  participating in the discussion are expected to be part of a live discussion.
- **Lightning Talk (New to 2021!)**: We define a lighting talk as an individual
  giving a quick introduction to pique interest in a specific STEM or LGBT+
  related topic. This may be a resource you have found interesting or an issue
  that future STEM professionals could investigate. These talks will be 8
  minutes long with 2 minutes for questions. This is an excellent opportunity to
  give an oral presentation if a 50 minute presentation is beyond the scope of
  your topic!

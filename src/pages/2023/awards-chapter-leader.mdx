## oSTEM Chapter Leader of the Year

### Award Description

This award recognizes the impact that strong, innovative, and passionate leaders
have on oSTEM chapters. The guiding purpose of the oSTEM organization is to
empower LGBTQ+ people in STEM to succeed personally, academically, and
professionally by cultivating environments and communities that nurture
innovation, leadership, and advocacy. Chapter leaders not only understand this
mission but strive to embody it in their personal and professional lives.
Whether they founded their chapter, created a tight knit community of members,
or created a network of connections, we want to hear about it! If your chapter
leader has made a significant effort toward achieving these goals on your campus
and in your community we ask you to nominate them so they can be recognized for
their efforts.

### Eligibility

- Must be a chapter leader of a verified Standard oSTEM Chapter or Affiliate
  Chapter of active status in good standing with your Regional Coordinator
- Must be attending the oSTEM Annual Conference

<br />

Self-nominations are accepted and encouraged. If you have any questions

Out in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (oSTEM) is now
accepting poster proposals for the in-person 13th Annual oSTEM Conference 2023.

The oSTEM Annual Conference Poster Session is intended for undergraduate
students, graduate students, and postdocs to showcase their research to other
conference attendees. Anyone performing academic or industry research is invited
to submit a poster for consideration. If you are interested in submitting a
poster please do so at the button below.

From the posters submitted, a number will be selected to give 10-minute oral
presentations with time for Q&A during our research symposium sessions. We will
be accepting symposium presenters on a rolling basis after the deadline for this
opportunity until all slots are filled. However, to be included in the published
symposium book, there is a hard deadline of September 1.

- **How will the posters be displayed?**

  We display the posters on an 8' x 4' free-standing cork board with push pins.

- **I noticed the poster session is during the Career Fair and Graduate School
  Expo. Can I still attend the expo and present a poster?**

  Yes! Please let the programming committee know that you plan on attending the
  career fair and promptly arrive at the start of the session. There will be
  about 20 minutes to attend after the session is over if you need additional
  time.

  Unfortunately, oSTEM cannot print your poster. We advise that you travel with
  your poster.

- **Do I have to participate in the research symposium to present a poster?**

  Nope! Feel free to just participate in the poster session.

- **How will I know if my poster was accepted for the poster session?**

  Due to the interdisciplinary nature of oSTEM as an organization as well as the
  programming committee, all submitted posters are accepted for the poster
  session. You should receive an email during October confirming your poster
  submission.

- **How will I know if my poster was accepted for the research symposium?**

  All submissions will receive an email mid-October regarding whether or not their submissions have been accepted.

- **Can I still present my poster if I wasn't accepted for the research
  symposium?**

  Of course!

- **When can I set my poster up?**

  Poster setup will be on Saturday morning and be available throughout the day
  on Saturday. Feel free to take a free moment to wander through the posters
  during the day.

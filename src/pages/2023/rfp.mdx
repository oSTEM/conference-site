## Program Format

</div>

There are three options for Program Submissions:

- **Workshop**: Workshops are defined as 1-2 speakers presenting on a program
  topic. All workshops are expected to be 50 minutes.

- **Panel**: Panels are defined as 3-4 speakers that each contribute a unique
  perspective on a similar topic. Panels can be collaborative across different
  universities, companies, and industries depending on the topic. In addition,
  panels should include historically marginalized voices. All panelists are
  expected to contribute and participate in the discussion. (Panels are limited
  to 4 presenter discount codes.)

- **Lightning Talk**: We define a lighting talk as an individual giving a quick
  introduction to pique interest in a specific STEM or LGBTQ+ related topic.
  This may be a resource you have found interesting or an issue that future STEM
  professionals could investigate. These talks will be 12 minutes long with 3
  minutes for questions. This is an excellent opportunity to give an oral
  presentation if a 50-minute presentation is beyond the scope of your topic!

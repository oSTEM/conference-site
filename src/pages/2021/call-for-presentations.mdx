The 2021 oSTEM and Annual Conference Poster Session is intended for undergraduate students, graduate students, 
and postdocs to showcase their research to other conference attendees. Anyone performing academic or industry 
research is invited to submit a poster for consideration. If you are interested in submitting a poster please 
do so at the link provided. In addition to a poster session, we will be having a research symposium, which will 
be ~15 minutes long that includes a 10 minute talk with 5 minutes Q&A after the presentation. There are a limited number of spots available for this presentation.

This year, poster presentations will be virtual. We will be using Gather to display posters to conference 
attendees, which will allow for a virtual engagement similar to an in-person poster session. You will have 
the option to respond to questions/comments throughout the duration of the conference.  


## Submission Milestones

- July 26: Call for Poster/Symposium Opens

## Submissions

There are two different categories to submit:

As part of the application process, you will be required to upload the poster in a zoomable PDF format. 

We will accept posters submissions on a rolling basis and you should hear back between 1-2 weeks after your poster submission indicating if your poster has been accepted. Final decisions on symposium talks will be communicated by **Friday, October 8, 2021**.

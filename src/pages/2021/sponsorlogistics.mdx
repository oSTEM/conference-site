**Pre-Conference Oppertunities:**

Sponsoring organizations are encouraged to participate in all parts of our conference, even those that happen prior to our event. Specifically, we encourage our sponsoring organizations to participate in the following parts of the program:

- **Career and Graduate School Bootcamp - Thursday, October 19, 7:00PM-8:30PM ET -** Help conference attendees brush up on their resumes / CVs, elevator pitches, and interview skills prior to the expo. This is an opportunity to scout out attendees early, invite folks back to your booth at the expo, start to fill your interview roster, and make sure attendees are in top shape for the expo floor. Event registration link TBD.

- **New to the Conference Session - TBD -** This session is especially helpful for those attendees who have never been to an oSTEM Conference before and want to learn the lay of the land. Conducted by members of the oSTEM Conference Committee, we’ll share ways to navigate the schedule and get the most out of your attendee experience. Event registration link TBD.

**Programming Highlights**

Sponsoring organizations are encouraged to participate in all parts of our conference, taking note of the participation limits set by the attendee type above. Specifically, we encourage our sponsoring organizations to participate in the following parts of the program:

Don’t be surprised if you see raffle drawings, on-site job/internship offers, iPads collecting contact information, and all the other trappings of your typical career fair. All sponsors with a booth will have the same booth for both Day 1 and Day 2 of the expo.

**Programming Changes from 2020**

We have expanded our programming session to include 10-minute lightning talks. These fast-paced session will allow our members to talk about a topic that they are passionate about that may range from quick tips for learning a new coding language to understanding the basics of a niche field. This is a great opportunity to learn about what our members are passionate about and how they intersect with LGBT + STEM identities.

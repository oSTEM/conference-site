    <h3>Conference for LGBTQ+ People in STEM</h3>
    <p>
      The 13th Annual oSTEM Conference will take place in Anaheim, California
      with 1,000+ LGBTQ+ students, professionals, and recruiters in STEM fields
      from across the country and around the globe. This space is designed for
      attendees to share their professional and personal experiences and learn
      from one another in an authentic and vulnerable way. Programs and content
      range from introspective (e.g., safer spaces to talk about queer issues
      and career development) to technical (e.g., discussing the latest in
      research conducted by our members). The Career & Graduate School Expo
      allows attendees to connect and network with professionals, academics, and
      colleagues from STEM industries and universities. For more examples of
      sessions, speakers, and career expo exhibitors, click here for the 2022
      conference program. If you want a space where you can be your authentic
      LGBTQ+ self and your authentic STEM self, this is the conference for you.

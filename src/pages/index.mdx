            <h3>Conference for LGBTQ+ people in STEM Fields</h3>
            <p>
                We're very excited to announce that our Annual Conference is returning to an in-person format for 2022.
                This conference is a space for LGBTQ+ students and professionals in STEM fields to share their experiences and learn from one another.
                We have programs ranging from safe spaces to talk about queer issues to discussing the latest in research conducted by our members.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want a space where you can be your authentic LGBTQ+ self and your authentic STEM self, this is the conference for you.
            </p>

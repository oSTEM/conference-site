            <p>
                The oSTEM Conference returns again this year in a virtual format.

        <h3>Affinity Group Breakouts and other Programs</h3>
        <p>
            One of the core programs we offer during our conference are our Affinity Group breakouts.
            We have 7 Affinity Groups: Ace/Aro, (Dis)Ability, InQUEERy, Middle Sexualities, Race and Ethnicity, Trans and Non-Binary, and Women.
            The breakouts during the conference is a safe space for those who identify with that group to share their unique experiences, discuss things in their community, and find support.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will also have other programming available, such as a Poster Session for our community members to present their research, professional development programs, and keynote sessions.
            More information about these other programs will be released closer to the conference.

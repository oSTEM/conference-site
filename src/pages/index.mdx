    <h3>Conference for LGBTQ+ People in STEM</h3>
    <p>
      The 15th Annual oSTEM Conference will take place in Baltimore, MD
      with 1,100+ LGBTQ+ students, professionals, and recruiters in STEM fields
      from across the country and around the globe. This space is designed for
      attendees to share their professional and personal experiences and learn
      from one another in an authentic and vulnerable way. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Programs and content range from introspective (e.g., safer spaces to talk about queer issues
      and career development) to technical (e.g., discussing the latest in
      research conducted by our members). The Career & Graduate School Expo
      allows attendees to connect and network with professionals, academics, and
      colleagues from STEM industries and universities. If you want a space where you can be your 
      authentic LGBTQ+ self and your authentic STEM self, this is the conference for you!
